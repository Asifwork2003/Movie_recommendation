    "# Movie Recommendation System Using KNN\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a movie recommendation system using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** based on user ratings and movie features. The recommendation system leverages **collaborative filtering** to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and ratings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The recommendation system follows these steps:\n",
    "1. **Data Loading**: Load the `ratings.csv` and `movies_rc.csv` datasets which contain movie ratings from users and movie details, respectively.\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data and explore the dataset to get useful insights.\n",
    "3. **User-Item Matrix Creation**: Create a sparse user-item matrix where each row represents a movie and each column represents a user.\n",
    "4. **Similarity Calculation**: Use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with cosine similarity to find similar movies based on user ratings.\n",
    "5. **Movie Recommendations**: Recommend movies to users based on their highest-rated movie, by finding the top `k` similar movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts:\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering**: A method of recommendation based on user-item interactions, where the system recommends items based on the preferences of similar users.\n",
    "- **Cosine Similarity**: A metric used to measure the similarity between two vectors by calculating the cosine of the angle between them.\n",
    "- **KNN**: An algorithm that finds the k-nearest neighbors to a given point (movie) based on some distance metric (cosine similarity in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Information:\n",
    "- **ratings.csv**: Contains user ratings for movies with columns `userId`, `movieId`, and `rating`.\n",
    "- **movies_rc.csv**: Contains movie details with columns `movieId` and `title`.\n",
